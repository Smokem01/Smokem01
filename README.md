## Hi, I'm Feres! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a computer science student and I'm passionate about problem solving, computer vision, machine learning, and building useful tools that solve real-world problems. Here's a look at some of the projects I've worked on:  

## ðŸŒ¿ [NDVI Plant Health Monitoring](https://github.com/Smokem01/NDVI-Plant-Health-Monitoring)
This project monitors plant health using an infrared camera on a Raspberry Pi. By analyzing infrared images, the system helps track plant health over time and provides valuable insights for agriculture and research.

Tech Stack: Python, NumPy, OpenCV  
Focus: Image processing, Raspberry Pi, vegetation health analysis  

## ðŸ’¼ [Invoice Generator](https://github.com/Smokem01/InvoiceGenerator)
A simple, customizable invoice generator that automates the process of creating professional invoices in .docx format. The tool helps users streamline billing and accounting tasks with a user-friendly interface.

Tech Stack: Java, Apache POI, Swing  
Focus: Document generation, user interface design, automation  

## ðŸš¦ [Traffic Sign and Violation Detection](https://github.com/mayssagritli/Traffic-Sign-and-Violation-Detection)
I contributed to this project by improving the algorithmic part, assisting in post-detection processing to identify violations, and processing the detections frame-by-frame. The goal is to analyze traffic signs and detect potential violations, enhancing road safety.

Tech Stack: YOLOv8, Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow  
Focus: Object detection, traffic sign analysis, deep learning
